Guilds are the core thematic and mechanical grouping of the game and they influence everything. The different guilds have different play styles, themes, and types of effects.

- **Characters** belong to guilds that give them unique abilities and also unique interactions with other game play elements.
- **Charms** are grouped into Guilds and the tech tree requires you have have certain numbers of guild prerequisites.
- **Discovery Cards** are grouped into guilds that dictate what kind of actions they provide and also the cost to the various players
- **Wishes** are grouped into guilds, with 1 wish per guild

There are four guilds: **Animal**, **Plant**, **Scholar**, and **Mage**. Each guild has a rival 
- Animal -> Plant  
- Scholar -> Mage

Guilds apply to discovery cards in a couple ways:
- It is less expensive to buy a discovery card that is of the same guild as you
- Theming of different discovery cards follows the guilds.

Guilds apply to Characters:
- The theme influences the special abilities of the Guilds
- They make it less expensive to work with discovery cards of the same guild
- Each player starts with the starting Charm of that guild

Guilds affect Charms:
- The abilities that charms produce are in keeping with the themes
- There are four categories of charms. And some charms require pre-requisites of multiple charms

Guilds affect wishes
- There are 4 wishes, each for one guild. Each with a primary and secondary action.
