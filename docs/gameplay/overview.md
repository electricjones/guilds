## Introduction
A high fantasy, asymetrical, strategic struggle between rival guilds using deck builder and area control mechanics. Aesthetic similar to Unstable Unicorns. Inspired by Clank, Twilight Imperium, and Root.

Exact theme not determined. Maybe Pepper and Carrot.
## Guilds and Characters
Guilds are the core thematic and mechanical grouping of the game and they influence everything. The different guilds have different play styles, themes, and types of effects.

There are four guilds: **Animal**, **Plant**, **Scholar**, and **Mage**. 
#### Animal
Very active guild that provides extra actions, animal helpers, and SOMETHING. Does not really interact with other players.

***Primary Attributes***: Speed, action, power, and helping each other (alliances).
#### Plant
Focus on resource and internal strength. Moderate mounts of interaction with other players. The most balanced of all of them.

***Primary Attributes***: Growth, nurturing, resources, resilience. 
#### Scholar
All about information. Allows you to see more, hide more, and do more rare things.

***Primary Attributes***: Intelligence, strategy, resourcefulness. 
#### Mage
Powerful and chaotic. Has many diverse actions, but at a cost and always at a risk. Has the most "take that" mechanics and mechanics that alter the state of the board.

***Primary Attributes***: Powerful actions, long rest times, risky moves, more take that.
## Components
- Tokens
	- Player Tokens (meeple)
	- Player Markers (used for various things)
	- Silver (as currency)
- Cards
	- **Guild Territory Cards**
	- **Trinkets**: The Starting Deck and standard deck building cards
	- **Discoveries**: The more interesting deck building cards you "buy"
		- Back: The Guild, the Cost, and the Tease
		- Front: The effects
	- **Wishes**: Single Use Per Round, very powerful actions. Similar to Strategy Cards. Primary and Secondary abilities.
	- **Charms**: Persistent abilities like TI techs. Gain them along a tech tree.
	- **Objectives**: Random objectives to score. Not the only way to get points, but must score objectives to win.
- Dice (not sure which weight): Used to modify some things at times

## Setup
- Game board is a 6 x 4 grid of Discovery Cards
	- Shuffle a 6 Guild Territory Cards and lay them out randomly in the grid
	- Sort the 4 decks of guild discover cards
	- Lay out the Guild Discover Cards:
		- Each Guild Territory card gets three face down discover cards in decending order. So (from the bottom) it is an Animal Territory Card, Level III Animal Discovery Card, Level II Animal Discovery Card, Level I Animal Discovery card
		- This forms a grid of randomly placed areas belonging to the different guilds. Each area is a stack of four cards with the territory on the bottom. All Discovery cards are face down so all you see is the Guild, the Cost, and The Tease
- Setup the Market
	- The four Wishes
	- The Trinkets (Gold, Points, Brooms, Explore, and Some Negative Cards)
	- The Charms
		- There are only 2 of each charm, so its a race to get to them (?)
		- Charms are grouped by Guild
- Each Play Area
	- Select your player (which also determines your guild)
	- The Starting deck of 12 cards
	- An area for your ingredient basket and charms
	- An area to lay out your drawn hands

## Resources
- All transactions in the game are some combination of Money, Ingredients, and Prerequisites
- Money is divided into Gold and Silver
	- There are two silver to a gold
	- Gold is only on cards and can only be used as they are drawn
	- Silver is kept as tokens and can be used anytime
- Ingredients
	- Ingredients are used for Discovery Cards. 
	- Ingredients are only in cards. You get some in the Market and others as discoveries.
- Prerequisites
	- Some more intense Discovery and Charm cards require you to have passed some milestone, complete some action, or have some ability
	- Charms have a tech tree you must climb
	- Other examples may be "have 5 points" or Claim two spaces adjacent to this one.
- All transactions can be combinations of any of the above. So you may need 3 Gold, 2 Ingredients and to have completed an objective.

## Playing the Game
The game is played in Rounds, each round is the same. The game goes until some win condition (to be determined later).

- Beginning the Round
	- Reveal the next objective
	- Distribute 2 silver (plus modifiers) to every player
	- ==Clear away "Recently Discovered"==, if any
	- Draw the first hand of 5 and resolve any "draw extra cards"
	- Place 3 cards face up and 2 cards face down, unless you have abilities otherwise
	- Select Wishes ==in order of who passed==
	- Ready any exhausted cards or abilities
- A Round plays until everyone passes with a few exceptions
	- Everyone MUST play at least 2 hands of cards. You can play 3 (+modifiers)
	- Every Wish must be granted, giving others the secondaries (which they can use even if they've passed)
- Playing the Round
	- Each turn you may:
		- Play your drawn hand by doing any of the following as many times as you can.
			- Spend its resources to buy the card you are on
			- Buy from the market
			- Move
			- Stake a Claim
			- Perform any actions on the cards
			- Place a number of ingredients into your basket for later use. This depends on your starting character + modifiers
			- Turn a gold into a silver to keep for later, but it looses half its value, rounded down
			- Move ingredients to your basket depending on your capacity. You may use your ingredients in the basket as if they are in your hand.
			- You may play through your hand in any order you want.
			- Typical deck building mechanics.
		- Perform the primary "wish" ability
			- Which then goes around to perform the secondaries
			- You can only perform 1 secondary in a round (+modifiers)
		- Buy from the market w/o using your drawn hand (only by using silver or abilities)
		- Use any charm or special ability.
		- Score any objective you have not yet scored
		- Pass for the round. 
- Moving, exploring, and claiming cards
	- You can move the number of spaces you have movement for (brooms + modifiers). 
	- Only move NSEW, not diagonally (unless an ability allows you)
	- You can see each discovery's purchase cost on the face down cards. As well as their guild and some teaser about what they do.
		- ==This will have to be done carefully so as to not give away every card==
	- Once on a new card, you can can **explore** that card using the required number of "Explore" cards from your hand. The deeper you go, the more explore cards you need.
		- If a card was just explored, you can immediately purchase it for an increased cost. The cost is increased only on the turn it was discovered.
		- ==What is the increased cost? Do you have to move off it to get the normal cost?==
	- You can also Claim the card, which makes it more expensive for others to buy.
- Purchasing Cards
	- You can purchase any card you are on by paying its cost.
		- That cost will be some combination of money, ingredients, and prerequisites
		- Plus any "claim" costs from other players
	- Once bought it goes into your deck
	- A few of the discoveries may be instant cards that you use immediately and then purge.
## Ending the Game
- I'm not sure what the ending game condition is. But I like the idea of the players choosing when it ends instead of a set number of rounds. Perhaps after the Xth objective is scored.
## Variations
- **Friendly**: Meant to be about an hour. Very few Take That. Competitive. The Above
- **Fiendly**: Add in more complex rules, combat, trading, and area control
- **Family**: All work together against monsters
## Other Game Analogues
- **Wishes** are similar to Strategy Cards from Twilight Imperium
- **Brooms** are similar to Boots from Clank
- **Charms** are similar to tech from Twilight Imperium
## Random Ideas and Notes
- Maybe the board grows every round or few rounds by adding rows and columns
